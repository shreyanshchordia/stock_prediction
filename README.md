# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Network

Research in the field of Stock Prediction isn't a new topic of interest. Stock prediction has been focused on since a 
long period of time. 

So what was the means of prediction of the stock prices when we didn't have sequential models that
understand the dependency of the current data on the previous data over the time sequence?
